Ic2ExpReactorPlanner_GA
====================

A forked version of Ic2ExpReactorPlanner with an added genetic algorithm component to search the huge reactor layouts possibility space.

Also upgraded gradle to gradle 4.10.3 so it's a _bit_ more modern.

TODO:
---
 - Cost efficiency fitness component
 - Tweak speciation settings
 - Finish refactoring EvolutionEngine
 - Figure out if I want to rely only on heatPenaltyMultiplier in fitness function or if I want to still have a maxHeat cutoff
 - Investigate if I could/should upgrade Gradle to latest version?
